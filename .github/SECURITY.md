Thank you for improving the security of `MEC`. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at [Josh.Haines@Rolls-Royce.com](mailto:Josh.Haines@Rolls-Royce.com).

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and may ask for additional information or guidance.

the module.
