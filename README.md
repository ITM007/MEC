# MEC
Meeting Efficiency Calculator (MEC)

## About
This code calculates the cost of meetings, and has user inputs to see if powerpoint was used.

Ex: If you have a meeting with 20 people for 120 min how much does that cost your company? This program will give you live updates so you can see by the second the cost of the meeting proice increase.

The valulation of each employee is at $200 per hour.

Powerpoint and long meetings kill productivity, this app hopes to show how much money is being lost in useless meetings.
